# R Scripts for data management and analysis

![](photo.jpg)




The LCAS is designed to provide rapid insights through efficiently collected surveys. In this page, we provide an overview of key workflows and analysis pipelines. The general steps in the workflow are as follows:

0. Data collection (see [survey deployment section](deployment/))
1. Importing data into the analysis envrionment (see [data import section](../toolbox/data_import))
2. Data cleaning (see [data cleaning section](../toolbox/data_cleaning))
3. Add calculated variables and geodata (see [add variables section](../toolbox/add_vars))
4. Run automated, simple analytics (see [generate report section](../toolbox/gen_report) and [show automated report section](../toolbox/show_report))
5. Run more advanced analytics requiring manual fine-tuning 

To get started, you may clone the LCAS github repo. It contains all the scripts and samples for how to run these scripts with existing anonymized datasets that have been collected for India.
