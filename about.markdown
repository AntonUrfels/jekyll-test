# LCAS overview

The LCAS system has been developed to provide timely and actionable information about agricultural systems to decision-makers. It has been pioneered in South Asia under the Cereal System Initiative for South Asia (CSISA). As of spring 2023, more than 50,000 datapoints have been recorded with 25,012 records being publicly available. A key aspect of the LCAS system is that the surveys are designed so that a household interview lasts no longer than 45min - allowing cost-effective collection of the most important variables and large spatial scales.

LCAS consists of modules for each key information aspect to cahracterize and analyze agriculural systems. Each module consists of a core set of survey questions and corresponding variables and additional extensions that may be added for specific crops or ecologies.

The current list of modules includes:
- Basic demographics
- Landholding
- Crop establishment
- Fertilizers
- Irrigation
- Weeding
- Pest and dieseases
- Socio-economics
- Harvesting and yield


More modules are under development and will be added soon.
